Subject: Database Layer Reorganization - Recommended Approach

Hi Team,

Following our discussion on separating the raw data layer (D_RAW) from the preservation layer (D_BRONZE), I've evaluated two approaches:

Option 1: DB RENAME

Pros	Cons
Simpler - single command	IDMC connection needs update
Grants follow automatically	Must create new D_BRONZE after
No re-granting needed	
Option 2: DB CLONE

Pros	Cons
Original DB stays intact	Grants do NOT transfer
Easy rollback	Need to re-grant all permissions
More complex setup
Quick Comparison:

Criteria	RENAME	CLONE
Complexity	⭐ Simple	⭐⭐⭐ Complex
Grants	Auto-follow	Need re-grant
Best for	Early development	Production

Recommendation: Since we're in the early development stage with minimal objects and no V1 tables yet, I recommend the DB RENAME approach. It's simpler, faster, and grants transfer automatically.

The only action required would be updating the IDMC connection from D_BRONZE to D_RAW after the rename.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best regards

Hi Team Good morning,

 

I have evaluated two approaches for on separating the raw data layer (D_RAW) from the preservation layer (D_BRONZE).

 

Option 1 :  DB RENAME

Pros

Cons

Simpler - Couple of commands

IDMC connection needs update

Grants follow automatically

Create new D_BRONZE and required Schema's after

No re-granting needed

 

 

Option 2 :  DB CLONE

Pros

Cons

Original DB stays intact

Grants do NOT transfer

Easy rollback

Need to re-grant all permissions

 

More complex setup

 

 

Quick Comparison

Criteria

RENAME

CLONE

Complexity

Complex

Grants

Need re-grant

Best for

Early development Stage

Production

 

My Suggestion : Since we are in the early development stage with minimal objects , I  would suggest to the DB RENAME approach. It is  simpler, faster, and grants transfer automatically.

 

The only action required would be updating the IDMC connection from D_BRONZE to D_RAW for impacted jobs.

 

Regads,

Thank you for joining the call on short notice to discuss and align on our approach for CDC operations in Snowflake. As agreed, we will move forward with creating a separate database (D_RAWCDC) to host the BASE and LOG tables, along with the associated Streams, Tasks, and Procedures. These components will be used to merge data and push changes (deltas) into the main table in the BRONZE layer.

 

Vishal and team, if you have a different name that you’d prefer for this new DB, please make your suggestion. 

 

Babu and Naveen will discuss on the best approach to set up this new database and communicate the plan to this group. 

 

Thanks,

David
