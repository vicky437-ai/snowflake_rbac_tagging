Subject: Database Layer Reorganization - Recommended Approach

Hi Team,

Following our discussion on separating the raw data layer (D_RAW) from the preservation layer (D_BRONZE), I've evaluated two approaches:

Option 1: DB RENAME

Pros	Cons
Simpler - single command	IDMC connection needs update
Grants follow automatically	Must create new D_BRONZE after
No re-granting needed	
Option 2: DB CLONE

Pros	Cons
Original DB stays intact	Grants do NOT transfer
Easy rollback	Need to re-grant all permissions
More complex setup
Quick Comparison:

Criteria	RENAME	CLONE
Complexity	⭐ Simple	⭐⭐⭐ Complex
Grants	Auto-follow	Need re-grant
Best for	Early development	Production

Recommendation: Since we're in the early development stage with minimal objects and no V1 tables yet, I recommend the DB RENAME approach. It's simpler, faster, and grants transfer automatically.

The only action required would be updating the IDMC connection from D_BRONZE to D_RAW after the rename.

Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further.

Best regards
